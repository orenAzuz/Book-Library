# Book Library
## Angular 5 demo project
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.4.
The carusel componenets all from https://github.com/bonjurmrfirst/angular4-carousel
I was needed to copy all the folders to my project
to make it work for the reason that the version was to old for 1.5.4. version.
In the projec I've been using material ,animate, scss and more.
connecting to a fake DB server to upload the data 
here on GitHub https://github.com/orenAzuz/Books/blob/master/db.json .
